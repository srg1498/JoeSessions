- hierarchical inheritance
  one base class is inherited by many derived classes
  tree like structure

  when we create derived class object in heap and store it in base class type pointer variable, so it only calls function
  of base classes.

  base class type pointers can point to derived class objects but vice versa is not possible.

  now what we want is base class type pointer should be able to call derived class functions only. This is achieved using virtual 
  keyword


- vtables and vpointers


  class Shape                                                                            Shape::sides()
  - vpointer                                                                             Shape::perimeter()
                                                                                         Triangle::sides()
                                                                                         Triangle::perimeter()
  class Triangle                                                                         Quadrilateral::sides()
  - vpointer                                                                             Quadrilateral::perimeter()
                                                                                         Pentagon::sides()
                                                                                         Pentagon::perimeter()
  class Quadriletral
  - vpointer

  
  class Pentagon
  - vpointer




  vtable of class Shape
  sides
  perimeter

  vtable of class Triangle
  sides
  perimeter


  class size will increase because of virtual tables and pointers. This will only be created if we use virtual keyword.

- virtual functions (normal ones) 
  pure virtual functions (having no definition)

  class having pure virtual functions is known as abstract class. Objects of abstract class can not be created.

  Java: abstract class concept in c++ is known as interface in Java

  in system design, whenever we use term like "create interface of this thing", by this we mean "create abstract class of this
  thing in c++"

  concrete class



- old printers : print(doc), scan(doc)
  modern printers : print(doc), scan(doc), 3dprint(doc), deprint(doc) 

  ISearch interface
  - searching(vector<int> arr, int num) = 0;

  LinearSearch
  - searching(vector<int> arr, int num){linear search algo};

  BinarySearch
  - searching(vector<int> arr, int num){}
