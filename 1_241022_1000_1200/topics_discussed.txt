1) Vectors
   - STL methods of vectors
   - dynamic array concept and logic and also internal implementation
   - custom implementation using classes
   - amorized analysis

2) operator overloading
   - concept
   - add operator
   - subscript operator

3) Linked lists
   - concept
   - class implementation
   - time complexity analysis (considering head, and also head-tail both)
   - advantage and disadvantage
   - middle point of list using slow and fast pointer
